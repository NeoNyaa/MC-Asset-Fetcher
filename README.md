# MC Asset Fetcher
A simple Python script which downloads all of the assets for Minecraft from version 1.6.1 to the current latest.

## Setup
- Install python
- Install the `requests` library

## Usage
- Run the file with python3 and accept the acknowledgement
- Wait for the script to run and do its thing.

## Issues
- If there are any issues I beg you to let me know or even help by issuing a pull request.

## Potential Improvements to be made
The following is some potential improvements that can be made by someone more experienced with python should anyone want to take it up \:D

- Multithreaded downloads
- Code cleanup
- Less janky solutions to major aspects of the code
- More elegant code (less hacky stuff and more it will work)
